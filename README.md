				        Tic-Tac-Toe

Thank you for trying out my first game made in Python. I am fairly pleased
in how it turned out as it is my first bigger project.

Instructions:

Input your player name after each round.

Show high scores (opens into a new window and has tabs for the different game modes).
		 (High Scores are saved throughout the sessions in a JSON file).

Toggle Music On/Off.

Select game mode "Best of 5", "Best of 10" or "Best of 20".

Select difficulty of the AI opponent.

Troubleshooting!

If the game board is non-responsive please use the "Reset Board" function.
